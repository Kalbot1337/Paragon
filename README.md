Currently working on recovering from a massive data transfer, and also working on attempting to globalize it, so that more users can use it, along with library localization, so that you don't have to download all in one shot, and that each version remains compatable.

##Todo List:

- Reprogram the entire thing so that it can update, or find the archive file (I wrote over it with TAILS, so this might not be possible really.)
